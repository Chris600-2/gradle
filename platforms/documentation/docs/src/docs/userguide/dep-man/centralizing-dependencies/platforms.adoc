[[platforms]]
= Platforms

Platforms are used to ensure that all dependencies in a project align with a consistent set of versions.

Platforms help you manage and enforce version consistency across different modules or libraries, especially when you are working with a set of related dependencies that need to be kept in sync.

[[sub:using-platform-to-control-transitive-deps]]
== Using a platform

A platform is a specialized software component used to control transitive dependency versions.
Typically, it consists of <<dependency_constraints.adoc#sec:adding-constraints-transitive-deps,dependency constraints>> that either recommend or enforce specific versions.
Platforms are particularly useful when you need to share consistent dependency versions across multiple projects.

In a typical setup you have:

- *A Platform Project*: Which defines constraints for dependencies used across different subprojects.
- *A Number of Subprojects*: Which depend on the platform and declare dependencies without specifying versions.

The <<java_platform_plugin.adoc#java_platform_plugin,`java-platform plugin`>> supports creating platforms in the Java ecosystem.
Platforms are also commonly published as Maven BOMs (Bill of Materials), which Gradle natively supports.

=== Declaring a Platform Dependency

To use a platform, declare a dependency with the `platform` keyword:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java-platform/recommender/kotlin/consumer",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=get-recommendations]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java-platform/recommender/groovy/consumer",files="build.gradle[tags=get-recommendations]"]
====

This notation automatically performs several actions:

- Sets the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/attributes/Category.html[`org.gradle.category` attribute] to platform, ensuring Gradle selects the platform component.
- Enables the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ModuleDependency.html#endorseStrictVersions--[`endorseStrictVersions`] behavior by default, enforcing strict versions defined in the platform.

If <<rich_versions.adoc#sec:strict-version,strict version>> enforcement isn't needed, you can disable it using the `doNotEndorseStrictVersions` method.

=== Creating a Platform Dependency

In Java projects, the `java-platform` plugin can be used to create a platform:

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("java-platform")
}

dependencies {
    constraints {
        api("com.google.guava:guava:30.1-jre")
        api("org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.12.0")
    }
}
----

This defines a custom platform with specific versions of `guava` and `commons-lang3` that can be applied in other projects.

[[sub:bom_import]]
== Importing Maven BOMs

Gradle supports importing https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Importing_Dependencies[BOMs], which are POM files containing `<dependencyManagement>` sections that manage dependency versions.

=== Regular Platform

To import a BOM, declare it using the `platform` keyword:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies-constraintsFromBOM/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-on-bom]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies-constraintsFromBOM/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-on-bom]"]
====

In this example, the Spring Boot BOM provides the versions for `gson` and `dom4j`, so no explicit versions are needed.

=== Enforced Platform

The `enforcedPlatform` keyword can be used to override any versions found in the dependency graph, but should be used with caution as it affects all consumers of your project:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies-enforcedConstraintsFromBOM/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-on-bom]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies-enforcedConstraintsFromBOM/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-on-bom]"]
====

== Creating a platform
TO DO

[[sub:platforms-vs-catalog]]
== Platform vs. Version Catalog

TO DO make a page with both, no versions, highlight why catalogs are not strict

Both platforms and version catalogs help manage dependency versions, but they serve different purposes:

- *Version Catalogs*: Centralize dependency versions and provide type-safe accessors, but do not influence the dependency graph. They are transparent to downstream consumers.
- *Platforms*: Act as components in the dependency graph and can enforce or suggest versions, affecting transitive dependencies.

Best Practices:

- Use version catalogs for defining and sharing dependency coordinates.
- Use platforms when you need to influence dependency resolution or enforce version alignment.

A project can use both a version catalog and a platform:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/catalogs-javaPlatformUsage/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=platform_uses_catalog]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/catalogs-javaPlatformUsage/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=platform_uses_catalog]"]
====
