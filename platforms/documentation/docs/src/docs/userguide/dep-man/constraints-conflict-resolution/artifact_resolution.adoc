Gradle allows you to customize how artifacts are resolved from a module dependency.

By default, when resolving a module from a Maven or Ivy repository, Gradle searches for a metadata file (like `pom.xml` or `ivy.xml`) and the default artifact file (typically a JAR).
However, there are scenarios where you might need to adjust how Gradle resolves these artifacts:

- **Non-standard artifacts:** The dependency provides an artifact without any metadata, such as a ZIP file.
- **Multiple artifacts in metadata:** A module defines more than one artifact (common with Ivy).
- **Specific artifact resolution:** You want to download only a specific artifact without its transitive dependencies.

== Resolving specific artifacts from a module dependency

Gradle's flexibility enables it to work with non-Java projects as well, such as downloading JavaScript libraries for a web application.
External JavaScript libraries can be treated like reusable Java libraries and downloaded from repositories.

To download a JavaScript library (e.g., JQuery) from a repository like link:https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/[Google Hosted Libraries], you can use artifact-only notation, separating the dependency's coordinates and artifact's file extension with the `@` symbol:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/declaringDependencies-artifactOnly/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-only-dependency-declaration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/declaringDependencies-artifactOnly/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-only-dependency-declaration]"]
====

This resolves the JavaScript artifact (e.g., a `.js` file) without any associated metadata.

Many libraries, including JavaScript libraries, ship multiple "flavors" of the same artifact.
For example, Java libraries often provide artifacts for compiled classes, source code, and Javadocs.
In JavaScript, you might have both uncompressed and minified versions of the library.

In Gradle, the _classifier_ (a concept from Maven/Ivy) can be used to select a specific variant of an artifact.
For example, to download the minified version of JQuery, you can specify the `min` classifier:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/declaringDependencies-artifactOnlyWithClassifier/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=artifact-only-dependency-declaration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/declaringDependencies-artifactOnlyWithClassifier/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=artifact-only-dependency-declaration]"]
====

In this case, the `min` classifier ensures that the minified JavaScript file is downloaded.
